READ ALL INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND THEN READ IT AGAIN

IMPORTANT - Complete the IPO below.

- Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You 
  don't need to comment every line.

========================

Write a program that gets a SINGLE string containing the person's first, 
middle and last names using input(). The program should output their first, 
middle and last initials. For example, the user enters "Bruce Lawrence 
Elgort", the program should display B.L.E. It must display exactly like this 
with the .'s after each letter with no spaces.

Use string slicing and other string methods as needed.

DO NOT ask for separate inputs.

You must have a SINGLE INPUT for the persons first, middle and last names.
