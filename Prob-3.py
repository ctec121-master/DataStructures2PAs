"""
An **acronym** is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a phrase and making a word from them. For example, RAM is an acronym for “random access memory.” Write a program that allows the user to type in a phrase and then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note: the acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the phrase are not capitalized.
