# INSTRUCTIONS

# There are 11 items that you need to complete.

# Add a comment above or to the right of each line of code in items 1-4
# describing what it does.
# Be specific. Use multiple comment lines if you need to.
# Make sure your file runs and generates the correct results.
# DO NOT delete or remove any of the comments in the assignment.
# Each of the things you need to do is sequentially numbered.

#- Insert your code below each comment section

def main():
    # Variables str1 and str2 are defined.
    # You don't need to do anything here.
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "World"

    # Demonstration
    print(str1[1])  # Print out the 2nd letter.

    # 1) What does this Python code do?
    print(str1[-2])

    # 2) What does this Python code do?
    print(str1[:3])

    # 3) What does this Python code do?
    print(str1[2:len(str1)-1])

    # 4) What does this Python code do?
    print(str1+str2)

    # 5) Write Python code below to iterate over the str1 and print each 
    # character separated by a space in a single line
    # Your code goes here. Please do not remove this comment.

    # 6) Create Python code that craetes two new variables list1 and list2.
    # Each of the variables should have a list of alphabetic characters 
    # assigned to it.
    # Your code goes here. Please do not remove this comment.

    # 7) Using a for loop, write Python code to print each character of the 
    # list1 on a new line. Also, use the accumulator pattern to rebuild the 
    # list elements using string concatenation.
    # Your code goes here. Please do not remove this comment.

    # 8) Write Python code that demonstrates you can append to list1 created 
    # above. Append 4 additional elements to the list, one at a time.
    # Your code goes here. Please do not remove this comment.

    # 9) Write Python code that demonstrates parsing of an input phrase into 
    # words in a list'
    # Your code goes here

    # 10) Write Python code that gets pi from the math library and outputs 
    # as "3.14" using string formatting for this. You can also use the Python 
    # round() function if you want.
    # Your code goes here. Please do not remvoe this comment.

    # 11) No coding required. Just answer the question in the space below
    # In the Python code below, what does line[:-1] evaluate to?
    # You should assume infile has been opened for reading a text file.
    # Also assume that the infile file is a text file with multiple lines, 
    # each line ending with a carriage return/linefeed character.
    '''
    for line in infile:
        print(line[:-1])
    '''

    # Your answer goes here. Please do not remvoe this comment.
