READ ALL INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND THEN READ IT AGAIN

IMPORTANT - Complete the IPO below.

- Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You 
  don't need to comment every line.

Write a program that accepts a sentence as input and converts each word to 
"Pig Latin" and prints the Pig Latin sentence as the output. To convert a word 
to Pig Latin you remove the first letter and place that letter at the end of 
the word. Then you append the string "ay" to the word.

YOU MUST ASK FOR A SINGLE SENTENCE AS INPUT.

Here is an example:

English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT

Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY

HINTS
========================
- Split the sentence into a list
- Iterate through each word using a loop
- Get the first character of each word and assign it to a variable
- Use string slicing to get the last character of each word
- Remove the first character from the word
- Append it to the end of the current word
- Use the accumulator pattern to build a string
